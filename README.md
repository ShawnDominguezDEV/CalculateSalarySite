# CalculateSalarySite
IntelliJ project to display a yearly salary based on user inputs.

This was the first assignment given during an Enterprise Web Development course at Texas State University.
The assignment was produced for Dr. Visinescu at Texas State University in the Fall of 2019.

This project accepts user inputs and uses them to create an Employee object that is stored in a servlet.
Based on user inputs, the employee object calculates the yearly salary and this displays an output on a separate page.

The objective of this project was to establish an understanding of Java classes, servlets, and navigating through different JavaServer pages.
